# Master-Thesis-Tasks-in-Python-on-HAR-for-Medical-Purposes-with-Wearable-Sensor
Some of the tasks involved are:

* Collecting real-world human activity measurements from  wearable sensors on participants and single-person physical activities.

* Cleaning the data and processing the signals by upsampling collected measurements due to inconsistencies in sampling rates from multiple sensor sources of a device.

* Data annotation was done by manually labelling the sensor measurements with unique integer values using Microsoft Excel.

* Data modelling by combining multiple sensor measurements (IMU, ECG, and pressure) to create a homogenous dataset.

* Designed 1D CNN, LSTM, and 1D CNN-LSTM for comparison.

* Conversion of the best-performing model to TFlite for deployment in an ARM Cortex M7 microcontroller.
