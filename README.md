# Master-Thesis-Tasks-in-Python-on-HAR-for-Medical-Purposes-with-Wearable-Sensor
Some of the tasks involved are:

Collecting real-world human activity measurements from a wearable sensor on participants.

Cleaning the data and pre-processing the signals due to inconsistencies in sampling rates from the multiple sensor sources.

Data modelling by combining multiple sensor measurements (IMU, ECG, and pressure) to create a homogenous dataset.

Developing 1D CNN, LSTM, and 1D CNN-LSTM for comparison.

Conversion of the best-performing model to TFlite for deployment in an ARM Cortex microcontroller.
